# Kaggle-AmEx-Competition

### American Express Default Prediction Competition

This repository contains some of the submissions that I have made in the competition. 

Till now I have used logistic regression with and without categorical variables, logistic regression with 5 fold cross validation. Then I used XGBoost.

I used **statsmodel** library to fit a logistic regression and then based on **p-value** I discarded a few variables as unsignificant. The score improved by 0.03.

Still in the early stages and have a lot to improve upon.
